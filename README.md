# Spark API Docs

Edit the haml file and generate the html file on the command line with:

    haml api.haml api.html

The highlightjs package only includes the languages we intend to use.

The Spark Devices TypeKit kit uses Proxima Nova Light, Light Italic,
and Bold, as well as Inconsolata for the monospaced code.
